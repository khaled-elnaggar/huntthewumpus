# Hunt the Wumpus
Java class for Hunt the Wumpus game implemented using Swing library
Requires Java 8+ to run

In this version, arrows only fire a distance of one room. Since bats relocate, we don't have to worry about the wumpus room being unreachable.
There are also 3 bats instead of 2, and you get 3 arrows instead of 5.
